> A real-time network traffic monitoring and attack detection system that establishes a **statistical baseline** of normal network behavior and raises alerts when anomalies or known attack patterns are detected.

## 🔍 Overview

The **Network Baseline Attack Detection System** is a Python-based cybersecurity tool designed to monitor live or captured network traffic, learn what "normal" looks like for a given network, and flag deviations that indicate potential attacks. Unlike traditional signature-only systems, this tool uses **statistical thresholding** and **behavioral analysis** alongside pattern matching to catch both known and anomalous threats.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Baseline Learning** — Automatically profiles normal network traffic (packet rate, byte volume, protocol distribution) over a configurable time window
- 🚨 **Real-Time Alerting** — Generates alerts when traffic deviates beyond statistical thresholds (mean ± N × std dev)
- 🔎 **Multi-Protocol Analysis** — Monitors TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, and DNS traffic simultaneously
- 🧠 **Attack Pattern Recognition** — Detects common attack signatures including SYN floods, port scans, ICMP floods, and ARP spoofing
- 📁 **PCAP Support** — Analyze pre-captured `.pcap` / `.pcapng` files as well as live interfaces
- 📈 **Traffic Statistics Dashboard** — View real-time counts, rates, top talkers, and protocol breakdown
- 🪵 **Logging** — All alerts and traffic summaries are saved to structured log files for audit and review
- ⚙️ **Configurable Thresholds** — Easily tune detection sensitivity through a config file

**Phase 1 – Baseline Collection:** During an initial observation window (default: 60 seconds), the system captures packets and builds a statistical profile of normal traffic — average packets per second, bytes per second, SYN/ACK ratios, etc.

**Phase 2 – Live Detection:** Post-baseline, incoming packets are compared against the profile in real time. Any metric exceeding the configured standard deviation threshold triggers an alert.

**Phase 3 – Pattern Matching:** In parallel, packets are inspected for known attack signatures (e.g., a flood of SYN packets with no ACK, repetitive ICMP echo requests, ARP replies with no prior request).

## 🎯 Attack Types Detected

| Attack | Detection Method |
|---|---|
| **SYN Flood (DoS)** | High SYN/ACK ratio + packet rate anomaly |
| **ICMP Flood (Ping Flood)** | ICMP packet rate exceeds baseline threshold |
| **UDP Flood** | Sudden spike in UDP traffic volume |
| **Port Scan** | Single source hitting multiple destination ports |
| **ARP Spoofing / Poisoning** | Unsolicited ARP replies or MAC changes |
| **DNS Amplification** | Unusually large DNS response sizes |
| **Brute Force (SSH/FTP)** | Repeated TCP connection attempts to port 22/21 |
| **Traffic Volume Anomaly** | General statistical deviation from baseline |

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Administrator / root privileges (required for raw packet capture)
- `libpcap` (Linux) or `Npcap` (Windows) installed

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/darkloverboi/network-baseline-attack-detection.git
cd network-baseline-attack-detection

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. (Linux) Verify you have capture permissions
sudo setcap cap_net_raw=eip $(which python3)
# OR simply run with sudo
```

### Dependencies

```
scapy>=2.5.0
psutil>=5.9.0
colorama>=0.4.6
tabulate>=0.9.0
pyshark>=0.6          # optional, for PCAP analysis
```

## 🖥️ Usage

### Monitor a Live Network Interface

```bash
# Run with root/admin privileges
sudo python3 main.py --interface eth0

# Set custom baseline duration (in seconds)
sudo python3 main.py --interface eth0 --baseline 120

# Set custom alert sensitivity (default: 2 standard deviations)
sudo python3 main.py --interface eth0 --threshold 3
```

### Analyze a PCAP File

```bash
python3 main.py --pcap pcap_samples/attack_traffic.pcap
```

### View Help

```bash
python3 main.py --help
```
